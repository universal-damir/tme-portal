**Subject:** TME Portal Update: New Email Autocomplete Feature Now Live

Dear TME Portal Users,

We're excited to announce a significant improvement to the email functionality in the TME Portal that will make your email composition faster and more intuitive.

## üéØ What's New

### **Smart Email Autocomplete with Team Photos**
The email input fields in all PDF generation forms now feature an enhanced, Outlook-style interface that includes:

- **Team Member Photos**: See actual profile photos when selecting team members
- **Smart Suggestions**: Type just 2 letters to see matching team members
- **Email Chips**: Selected recipients appear as visual tags with photos and names
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Add emails using Enter, Tab, Space, or comma keys
- **Helpful Guidance**: Clear tooltips show available keyboard shortcuts

## üí° How It Works

1. **For Team Members**: 
   - Start typing a name or email (minimum 2 characters)
   - Select from the dropdown showing photos and department info
   - Team members appear with their profile photo and full name

2. **For External Emails**:
   - Type the complete email address
   - Press Enter, Tab, Space, or comma to add
   - External emails appear with a clean email icon

3. **Easy Management**:
   - Click the X on any chip to remove that recipient
   - Use Backspace on empty input to remove the last added email
   - Visual distinction between team and external contacts

## üìç Where You'll See This

## üöÄ Benefits
