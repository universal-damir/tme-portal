# Production Recovery and Fix Attempts Recap
## Date: August 30, 2025

## Initial Problem
- User deployed to production following the deployment guide
- UI was working but database had issues
- Lost access to 124 applications and 28 notifications from earlier in the day (used at 12:00-13:00)

## 1. DATA RECOVERY PHASE (SUCCESS)

### Problem Found:
- Deployment created NEW Docker volumes instead of using existing ones
- Old data was in `tme-production-deploy_postgres_data` volume
- New deployment created `tme-user_postgres_data` volume
- Result: Lost all applications and notifications

### Recovery Steps:
1. Found old Docker volume with data intact
2. Started recovery container: `docker run -d --name recovery-postgres -v tme-production-deploy_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`
3. Found 124 applications and 28 notifications in old volume
4. Created backups of recovered data
5. Restored data to current database

### Data Restored:
- ✅ 124 applications (later grew to 130)
- ✅ 28 notifications  
- ✅ 45 users
- ✅ All passwords and sessions preserved

## 2. CLIENT DATA ISSUE (FIXED)

### Problem:
- CIT letters feature couldn't load clients
- Clients table was empty (0 records)

### Solution:
1. Found 339 clients in LOCAL dev database
2. Exported from local: `docker exec tme-portal-1-postgres-1 pg_dump -U tme_user -d tme_portal -t clients --data-only > clients_export.sql`
3. Transferred to server and imported
4. ✅ 339 clients now available

## 3. URGENCY CONSTRAINT ISSUE (STILL BROKEN)

### Problem:
- Cannot submit applications for review
- Error: "violates check constraint applications_urgency_check"
- Database expects: 'low', 'medium', 'high'
- Application sending: 'standard'

### Root Cause Found:
- Frontend hooks (useCostOverviewApplication.ts, useGoldenVisaApplication.ts, etc.) have:
  ```typescript
  urgency: 'standard'
  ```
- Backend API route maps urgency but also expects 'standard':
  ```typescript
  urgency: urgency === 'urgent' ? 'high' : 'standard'  // Should be 'medium'
  ```

### Fix Attempts:

#### Attempt 1: Database Constraint Updates
- ✅ Dropped and recreated urgency constraint
- ✅ Added 'cit-return-letters' to type constraint
- ❌ Still failing because code sends 'standard'

#### Attempt 2: Docker Image Rebuild (tme-portal-server:latest-fix)
- Fixed line 239 in submit-review route: 'standard' → 'medium'
- Built new Docker image
- Deployed to server
- ❌ Image only had partial fix (not hooks)

#### Attempt 3: Another Docker Image (tme-portal-server:urgency-fix)
- Fixed the validation check in API
- Built and transferred 308MB image
- ❌ Still had old hooks code

#### Attempt 4: Fast Deploy Method
- Fixed all 4 hooks locally (urgency: 'standard' → 'medium')
- Built with `npm run build`
- Created 26MB tar.gz package
- Tried to deploy with docker cp
- ❌ Files showing old timestamps (19:07)
- ❌ Docker cp failed with read-only filesystem errors

#### Attempt 5: Complete Fix Build
- Fixed all hooks + API route
- Created update-urgency-fix-FINAL.tar.gz
- Transferred to server
- ❌ Could not properly deploy due to container filesystem issues

## Current State:

### What's Working:
- ✅ All data recovered (130 apps, 28 notifications, 339 clients, 45 users)
- ✅ Web interface accessible
- ✅ Login/authentication working
- ✅ CIT letters can see clients

### What's NOT Working:
- ❌ Cannot submit any application for review
- ❌ Golden Visa review submission broken
- ❌ CIT letters reviews submission broken
- ❌ All review submissions fail with "standard" urgency error

### The Core Problem:
1. **Old Docker image from Aug 20** was deployed initially
2. **Multiple partial fixes** created but none fully deployed
3. **Frontend JavaScript** in browser chunks still has `urgency: 'standard'`
4. **Backend expects** 'medium' but receives 'standard'
5. **Fast Deploy failed** due to read-only filesystem in container

## Files Created During Recovery:

### On Server:
- ~/backup_working_state_[timestamp].sql - Full database backup
- ~/recovered_full_database_[timestamp].sql - Recovered data
- ~/clients_export_[timestamp].sql - Client data from dev
- ~/tme-portal-server-latest-[timestamp].tar.gz - First fix attempt
- ~/tme-portal-server-urgency-fix-[timestamp].tar.gz - Second fix attempt  
- ~/update-urgency-fix-FINAL.tar.gz - Complete fix (not deployed)

### Docker Images on Server:
- tme-portal-server:latest - Current broken image
- tme-portal-server:latest-fix - Partial fix (API only)
- tme-portal-server:20250820 - Original old image

## What Went Wrong:

1. **Deployment Guide Issues:**
   - Created new volumes instead of preserving data
   - Used old Docker image from Aug 20
   - No data migration included

2. **Fix Attempts Issues:**
   - Built multiple partial fixes instead of one complete fix
   - Fast Deploy method incompatible with container filesystem
   - Docker images built before all code was fixed

3. **Current Blocker:**
   - Container has OLD compiled JavaScript
   - Browser loads OLD chunks with urgency: 'standard'
   - Cannot update files in running container (read-only)
   - Need complete rebuild with ALL fixes

## Next Steps Needed:

1. Build ONE complete Docker image with:
   - All 4 hooks fixed (urgency: 'medium')
   - API route fixed (urgency mapping)
   - Fresh build of all JavaScript chunks

2. Deploy properly:
   - Stop old container
   - Deploy new complete image
   - Verify files have correct timestamps

3. Clear browser cache to load new JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

1. Always backup before deployment
2. Check Docker volume names before deploying
3. Build complete fixes, not partial ones
4. Fast Deploy doesn't work with read-only containers
5. Frontend and backend must be fixed together
