## Technical Architecture

### Database Design
```sql
applications (
  id, type, title, form_data, status, 
  submitted_by_id, reviewer_id, review_comments, 
  urgency, submitted_at, reviewed_at, created_at, updated_at
)

notifications (
  id, user_id, type, title, message, 
  application_id, is_read, created_at
)
```

### Component Structure
```
src/components/review-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ modals/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ReviewSubmissionModal.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ReviewModal.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ StatusBadge.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ReviewTimeline.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NotificationPanel.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useNotifications.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useReviewSystem.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useReviewers.ts
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â”œâ”€â”€ reviewHelpers.ts
    â””â”€â”€ notificationHelpers.ts
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/notifications` - User notifications
- `POST /api/applications` - Create/update application
