# Internal Network Optimization for TME Portal

## Context
- **Environment**: Air-gapped internal network (no internet access)
- **Users**: 50-100 trusted staff members only
- **Issue**: Server crashes and 429 errors

## Root Cause Analysis
The original problem was NOT from too many requests, but from:
1. **Database connection pool too small** (only 20 connections for 100 users)
2. **Unnecessary rate limiting** for a trusted internal network
3. **React infinite loop** in cost overview form

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Increased Database Pool Size
**File**: `src/lib/database.ts`

**Changed**:
- Pool max: 20 → 100 connections
- Connection timeout: 2s → 5s
- Added query timeout: 10s (prevents hanging queries)

**Why**: With 100 users, you need more connections. Each active user might need 1-2 connections.

### 2. ✅ Removed Rate Limiting
**Files**: 
- `src/middleware.ts` 
- `src/app/api/notifications/route.ts`

**Why**: 
- Rate limiting is for PUBLIC internet apps to prevent attacks
- Your 50-100 users are TRUSTED employees
- No external access = no need for rate limiting
- Simpler code = fewer bugs

### 3. ✅ Fixed React Infinite Loop
**File**: `src/components/cost-overview/hooks/useFormattedInputs.tsx`

**Changed**: Removed `JSON.stringify()` from useEffect dependency array (line 310)

**Why**: JSON.stringify creates a new string every render, causing infinite re-renders

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- 20 database connections for 100 users
- Rate limiting blocking legitimate requests
- Complex rate limiting logic slowing down responses
- React infinite loop crashing browser

### After:
- 100 database connections (1 per user)
- No unnecessary rate limiting overhead
- Simpler, faster code
- Stable React components

## What This Means for Your Environment

### ✅ Perfect for Internal Network:
- No rate limiting needed (all users are trusted)
- Database pool sized for your actual user count
- Simpler code that's easier to maintain

### ✅ Security Still Maintained:
- Authentication still required
- Session management still active
- Security headers still applied
- Just removed the unnecessary rate limiting

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Can handle 100 concurrent users
- [ ] No 429 errors during normal use
- [ ] Notifications work without delays
- [ ] Cost overview form doesn't crash
- [ ] Database doesn't run out of connections

## Future Considerations

If you ever move to internet-facing:
1. Re-enable rate limiting
2. Add DDoS protection
3. Implement stricter security

But for internal network with 50-100 users:
**Current setup is optimal - simple, fast, and reliable**

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create deployment package**:
   ```bash
   tar -czf update-internal-network-fix.tar.gz \
     .next/standalone/ \
     .next/static/ \
     public/
   ```

3. **Deploy to server** (using Fast Deploy method)

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Database connection count: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;`
- Should stay under 100 even with all users active
- No 429 errors in logs
- Smooth performance

## Summary

**The fix**: Removed unnecessary complexity (rate limiting) and properly sized the database pool for your actual needs.

**Result**: A simpler, faster, more reliable system perfect for your internal network use case.
